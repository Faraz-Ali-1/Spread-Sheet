# Spread-Sheet

**Project Overview**
This is a lightweight, web-based spreadsheet application designed to perform fundamental mathematical operations and common formulas (like SUM) directly within a browser interface. It allows users to input numerical data into cells and instantly calculate results based on cell references.

**Features**
Real-time Calculation: Formulas update instantly as soon as data in a referenced cell is changed.

Basic Arithmetic: Supports standard addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

Built-in Functions: Includes common functions, starting with the SUM() function, to easily calculate totals across a range of cells.

Cell Referencing: Allows formulas to target specific cells (e.g., =A1+B2).

Clear Interface: A clean, easy-to-use grid structure.

**Technologies Used**
This project is built using standard web technologies with a focus on client-side logic:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
